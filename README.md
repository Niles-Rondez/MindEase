# MindEase
MindEase is a lightweight, AI-assisted mobile and web application designed to help users track and improve their mental wellness. The app enables users to record daily thoughts and moods through text and photo journal entries. Using AI-powered sentiment analysis and mood tracking, the system generates personalized activity and self-care suggestions, such as guided meditations and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) exercises based on initial user preferences gathered via a survey.

The MVP will focus strictly on essential features: user authentication, journal and mood tracking with basic sentiment analysis, AI-generated weekly mood summaries, and activity suggestions. Advanced features like real-time chatbot therapy, social features, or professional therapist integration are excluded to ensure the product is achievable within 5 weeks by a team of 4 developers.
